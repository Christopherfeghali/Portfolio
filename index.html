		<h1>Skilled in OOP languages, Databases and Web-design</h1>
		<p>A University of Nottingham graduate with a 2:1 degree in Computer science (BSc) seeking an entry-level position as a Software engineer. Whilst obtaining my degree I have developed skills in time management, communication skills, team work, working under pressure to deliver clear and concise material. This is proven by the fact that I needed to balance academic studies as well as duties as the class representative and volunteer work in matters such as community service, clubs and societies. I am looking for a challenging work environment that allows me to expand my skillset and experience within the industry. Willing to relocate countries if needs be.</p>
